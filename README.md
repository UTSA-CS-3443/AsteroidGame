# AsteroidGame

Repo for team: Undecided

## Description

Shoot asteroids, acquire upgrades, dodge downgrades. And also dodge asteroids too, I guess.

## Dependencies

Java 9.0.4 (Later versions might work, but are not tested.)

JavaFX (I can't find the version number in eclipse. Good luck.)

## Running

Nothing special. Just import the project into eclipse, make sure JavaFX is on the class path, and use `game.Main` as the main class.
